# Cypress Testing Workshop

An example repo containing a Todo application and exercise files to get started and/or increase your knowledge with Cypress. This was originally forked from [Cypress' testing-workshop-cypress repo](https://github.com/cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress).

## Requirements

- Any computer: Mac, Windows, Linux
- Text Editor or IDE of choice (preferably [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
- [Node 16.15.0+ (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com) (optional)

## Getting Started

In order to get the code and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdcruz/atd-introduction-to-cypress.git
cd atd-introduction-to-cypress
npm install
```

If necessary, install dependencies inside TodoMVC folder

```bash
cd todomvc
npm install
```

## Starting the Todo Application

```bash
cd todomvc # if you're not in todomvc folder yet, otherwise ignore this
npm start
```

and you should see in the terminal

```text
